    .SYNOPSIS
    DSC resource for configuring Windows services.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Carbon_Service` resource configures Windows services, including name, credentials, startup type, state, failure actions, and dependencies.

    The service is installed when the `Ensure` property is set to `Present`. If the service already exists, and its configuration doesn't match the properties being set, the service is stopped, its configuration updated, and the service is restarted. Properties not passed are ignored/left as-is.

    In addition to installing the service, this resource also grants the service user the logon as a service privilege and execute permissions on the service executable.

    The service is uninstalled when the `Ensure` property is set to `Absent`. The service is stopped, then uninstalled.

    `Carbon_Service` is new in Carbon 2.0.
