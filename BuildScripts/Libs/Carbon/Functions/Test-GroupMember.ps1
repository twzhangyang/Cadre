function Test-GroupMember

    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests if a user or group is a member of a *local* group.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Test-GroupMember` function tests if a user or group is a member of a *local* group using [.NET's DirectoryServices.AccountManagement APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.directoryservices.accountmanagement.aspx). If the group or member you want to check don't exist, you'll get errors and `$null` will be returned. If `Member` is in the group, `$true` is returned. If `Member` is not in the group, `$false` is returned.

    The user running this function must have permission to access whatever directory the `Member` is in and whatever directory current members of the group are in.

    This function was added in Carbon 2.1.0.

    .EXAMPLE
    Test-GroupMember -GroupName 'SithLords' -Member 'REBELS\LSkywalker'

    Demonstrates how to test if a user is a member of a group. In this case, it tests if `REBELS\LSkywalker` is in the local `SithLords`, *which obviously he isn't*, so `$false` is returned.
