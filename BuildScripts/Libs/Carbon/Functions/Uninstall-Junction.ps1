function Uninstall-Junction

    .SYNOPSIS
    Uninstall a junction.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Uninstall-Junction` removes a junction that may or may not exist. If the junction exists, it is removed. If a junction doesn't exist, nothing happens.
    
    If the path to uninstall is not a direcory, you *will* see errors.

    `Uninstall-Junction` is new in Carbon 2.0.

    Beginning in Carbon 2.2.0, you can uninstall junctions whose paths contain wildcard characters with the `LiteralPath` parameter.
