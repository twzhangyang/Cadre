function Remove-Junction

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Removes a junction.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    `Remove-Junction` removes an existing junction. 
    
    In Carbon 2.1.1 and earlier, the `Path` paramater does not support wildcard characters, nor can it delete junctions that contained wildcards.

    Carbon 2.2.0 added support for wildcards in the `Path` parameter. If using wildcards, if the wildcard pattern doesn't match any junctions, nothing is removed and you'll get no errors. If the `Path` parameter does not contain wildcards, `Path` must exist and must be a path to a junction.

    Carbon 2.2.0 also added the `LiteralPath` parameter. Use it to delete junctions whose path contains wildcard characters.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-Junction -Path 'C:\I\Am\A\Junction'
    
    Removes the `C:\I\Am\A\Junction` path.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-Junction -path 'C:\Temp\*'

    Demonstrates how to use wildcards to delete multiple junctions in a directory. Nothing happens if the wildcard doesn't match any junctions.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-Junction -LiteralPath 'C:\Temp\ContainsWildcards[]'

    Demonstrates how to use the `Literalpath` parameter to delete a junction that contains wildcard characters.
