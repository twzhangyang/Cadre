function ConvertFrom-Base64

    .SYNOPSIS
    Converts a base-64 encoded string back into its original string.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    For some reason. .NET makes encoding a string a two-step process. This function makes it a one-step process.
    
    You're actually allowed to pass in `$null` and an empty string.  If you do, you'll get `$null` and an empty string back.

    .EXAMPLE
    ConvertFrom-Base64 -Value 'RW5jb2RlIG1lLCBwbGVhc2Uh'
    
    Decodes `RW5jb2RlIG1lLCBwbGVhc2Uh` back into its original string.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    ConvertFrom-Base64 -Value 'RW5jb2RlIG1lLCBwbGVhc2Uh' -Encoding ([Text.Encoding]::ASCII)
    
    Shows how to specify a custom encoding in case your string isn't in Unicode text encoding.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    'RW5jb2RlIG1lIQ==' | ConvertTo-Base64
    
    Shows how you can pipeline input into `ConvertFrom-Base64`.
