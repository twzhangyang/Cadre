function Disable-AclInheritance

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Protects an ACL so that changes to its parent can't be inherited to it.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Items in the registry or file system will inherit permissions from its parent.  The `Disable-AclInheritnace` function disables inheritance, removing all inherited permissions. You can optionally preserve the currently inherited permission as explicit permissions using the `-Preserve` switch.
    
    This function is paired with `Enable-AclInheritance`.

    Beginning in Carbon 2.4, this function will only disable inheritance if it is currently enabled. In previous versions, it always disabled inheritance.

    .EXAMPLE
    Disable-AclInheritance -Path C:\Projects\Carbon
    
    Removes all inherited access rules from the `C:\Projects\Carbon` directory.  Non-inherited rules are preserved.
    
    .EXAMPLE
    Disable-AclInheritance -Path hklm:\Software\Carbon -Preserve
    
    Stops `HKLM:\Software\Carbon` from inheriting acces rules from its parent, but preserves the existing, inheritied access rules.
