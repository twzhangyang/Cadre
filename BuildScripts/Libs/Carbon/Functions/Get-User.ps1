function Get-User

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets *local* users.

    .DESCRIPTION
    `Get-User` gets all *local* users. Use the `UserName` parameter to get  a specific user by its username.

    The objects returned by `Get-User` are instances of `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal`. These objects use external resources, which, if they are disposed of correctly, will cause memory leaks. When you're done using the objects returne by `Get-User`, call `Dispose()` on each one to clean up its external resources.

    `Get-User` is new in Carbon 2.0.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement.UserPrincipal.
