function Add-GroupMember

    .SYNOPSIS
    Adds a users or groups to a *local* group.

    .DESCRIPTION
    You would think it's pretty easy and straight-forward to add users/groups to a local group, but you would be wrong.  The quick solution is to use `net localgroup`, but that won't accept user/group names longer than 24 characters.  This means you have to use the .NET Directory Services APIs.  How do you reliably add both users *and* groups?  What if those users are in a domain?  What if they're in another domain?  What about built-in users?  Fortunately, you're brain hasn't exploded.

    So, this function adds users and groups to a *local* group.

    If the members are already part of the group, nothing happens.

    The user running this function must have access to the directory where each principal in the `Member` parameter and the directory where each of the group's current members are located.

    .EXAMPLE
    Add-GroupMember -Name Administrators -Member EMPIRE\DarthVader,EMPIRE\EmperorPalpatine,REBELS\LSkywalker

    Adds Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Luke Skywalker to the local administrators group.

    .EXAMPLE
    Add-GroupMember -Name TieFighters -Member NetworkService

    Adds the local NetworkService account to the local TieFighters group.
